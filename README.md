# MarketFit 🌍

**Compare your Amazon product across marketplaces — instantly.**

MarketFit is an open-source tool that helps Amazon sellers identify the most profitable marketplace for their products. Enter an ASIN, select marketplaces, and get a side-by-side comparison of price, competition, and reviews.

---

## Why MarketFit?

Selling on multiple Amazon marketplaces is complex. Prices vary, competition differs, and demand shifts across regions. MarketFit pulls real data via the Amazon SP-API to help sellers make informed expansion decisions — without manually checking each marketplace.

## Features

- 🔍 ASIN lookup across multiple Amazon marketplaces (US, CA, FR, DE, UK...)
- 📊 Side-by-side comparison : price, number of sellers, reviews, ratings
- 📈 Keepa price history chart integration _(coming soon)_
- ⚡ Built on real SP-API data — not scraping
